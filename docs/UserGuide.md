ArchDuke is an **application to help students manage student contacts, groups, and group tasks, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). 
This product is also optimized for students to **update and keep track of members of student groups and tasks in each group**.
If you can type fast, ArchDuke can get your contact management, group management, and task management done faster than traditional GUI apps.

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * **`list`** : Lists all student contacts.

   * **`add`**`n/John Doe p/12345678 e/johndoe@u.nus.edu a/Computer Science t/friends` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to ArchDuke.

   * **`clear`** : Deletes all entries in ArchDuke.

   * **`exit`** : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

# Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

`PHONE_NUMBER`, `EMAIL`, and `ACADEMIC_MAJOR`. `TAG` is optional. 

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Note:**<br>

A student contact can only be added if it **has yet to exist** in ArchDuke. The student contact 
is uniquely identified by his `NAME` with **no regards to case sensitivity**. E.g. `John Doe` would be the 
same person as `john doe`

</div>

Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ACADEMIC MAJOR [t/TAG]`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Tip:**<br>

A student contact can have any number of tags (including 0)

</div>

Example: 

* `add n/John Doe p/12345678 e/johndoe@u.nus.edu a/Computer Science t/friends`
* `add n/Joel Lee p/87654321 e/joellee@u.nus.edu a/Information Systems`

Expected outcome:

* Student’s contact information is visible in ArchDuke and added to student contact list.

### Delete student contact information: `delete`

Deletes a student contact information at the specified `INDEX` from ArchDuke.
The `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the **currently displayed** student contact list. 
The `INDEX` **must be a positive integer**. The deleted student contact would also be 
deleted from all his currently assigned groups.

Format: `delete INDEX`

Example: 

* `delete 1`
* `list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the second person in the current list from ArchDuke.
* `find n/Bernice` followed by `delete 1` deletes the first person in the current resulting list of the `find` command.

Expected outcome:

* The student contact is removed from ArchDuke. The student contact is also removed from all previously assigned groups.

### Locating student contacts by attributes: `find`

Locates all student contact in ArchDuke based on attributes that matches the given keywords. 
* The attributes supported are: `n/NAME`, `p/PHONE_NUMER`, `e/EMAIL`, `a/ACADEMIC_MAJOR`, `t/TAG`
* The specified keywords are **case-insensitive**. 
* The attributes could be accessed by adding prefixes before the keywords.
* The result must match the **exact wording**, partial words will not match (e.g. `n/Dav` will not match the student contact
`David` or `David Li`).
* The command will list out all student contacts that matches the keyword.
  * `find n/Alex` would match with `Alex Yeoh` and `Alex Yu`
  * `find n/Alex Yeoh` would match with `Alex Yeoh` and `Alex Yu`
  * `find n/Alex Yu` would match with `Alex Yeoh`, `Alex Yu`, and `Bernice Yu`
  

* The attributes supported **multiple findings** at the same time are `n/NAME`, `a/ACADEMIC_MAJOR`, and `t/TAG`
  * `find n/Alex David` is possible and would show two results as `Alex Yeoh` and `David Li`, assuming that these are the only matching contacts.
  * `find a/Computer Science Business` is possible and would show contacts that has the following major: `Computer Science`, `Business`, `Business Analytics`
  , assuming that these majors are the exhaustive majors in the student contacts.
  * `find t/friends colleagues` is possible and would show contacts that has the at least one of the 2 tags: `friends` and `colleagues`


* The attributes **not supported multiple findings** at the same time are `p/PHONE_NUMBER` and `e/EMAIL`
  * `find e/example@u.nus.edu student@u.nus.edu` is not possible as `find` command only supports finding one `EMAIL` at a time (e.g. `find e/example@u.nus.edu` or `find e/student@u.nus.edu`)
  * `find p/12345678 87654321` is not possible as `find` command only supports finding one `PHONE_NUMBER` at a time (e.g. `find p/12345678` or `find p/87654321`)

Format: `find PREFIX/KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]` for these `PREFIX`: `n/`, `a/`, `t/`

Format: `find PREFIX/KEYWORD` for these `PREFIX`: `e/`, `p/`

Example:

* `find n/Alex David` or `find n/Alex`
* `find p/98765432`
* `find e/example@u.nus.edu`
* `find a/Computer Science` or `find a/Security`
* `find t/friends colleagues` or `find t/colleagues`

Expected outcome:

* Lists all student contacts that match with those attributes and displays the number of student contacts that 
match those keywords.
